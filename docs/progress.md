## 2026-05-20 00:32 Europe/Vilnius - Codex

- Before: Add a `vilnius_events` source adapter for ingesting events from vilnius-events.lt.
- Areas: Source adapter, source registry/config, tests, sample config/docs as needed.
- After: Added `vilnius_events` listing parser, registered it, validated config, added sample config/docs, and covered the parser with a fixture test.
- Verification: `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache uv run pytest`; `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache uv run ruff check .`; `git diff --check`; live parser smoke against `https://www.vilnius-events.lt/en/` returned 68 records.
- Follow-up: Consider detail-page enrichment later if listing cards do not provide enough context for evaluation.
